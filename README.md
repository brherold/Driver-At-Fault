ML Predictor for At-Fault Drivers ðŸš—ðŸ’¥

This project aims to predict the at-fault car in a crash using machine learning models trained on features like speed, weather conditions, and driver behavior. By preprocessing data, engineering features, and evaluating multiple models, the project achieves a highly accurate prediction of the at-fault party.

Project Overview ðŸ“‹
Accurately determining the at-fault driver in a car crash is critical for insurance claims and safety assessments. This project leverages machine learning to automate this process with an accuracy rate of 89%.
